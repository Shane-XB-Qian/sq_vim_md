## vimmd
- this is a simple way (assistant) to edit markdown file via vim directly without any gui or plugin help.
- it would pop up a vim@xterm and a page@web-browser with auto-refresh, while your editing and ':w', you can see the view changed in the web-browser.

## note
- i (shane) only tested under linux64 ubuntu (or *ubuntu) v18.04 ..
- mostly just a play to myself, No Guarantee it would work always .. :)

## installation
* 1: `sudo apt install markdown`
* 2: `download 'vimmd' from this repo`

## usage
`./vimmd yourMdFileName`

## update

- just a play, and forgot src code somewhere, perhaps useful to someone still..
- though can be made by vim itself also, or some 3rd part plugins too, should be.
