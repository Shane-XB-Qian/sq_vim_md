## vimmd
- it's a simple toy which no gui editer and/or even no vim plugin help can directly edit the md file at vim while seeing the effection in the web-browser.
- it would pop up a vim@xterm and a page@web-browser with auto-refresh, while your editing and ':w', you can see the view changed in the web-browser.

## note
- it only supports ubuntu (family) linux64 with default bash !
- just a play to myself, No Guarantee it would work always.. :)
